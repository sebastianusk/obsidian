hey morning, let's fix everything before we go

- [[Datadog]]being asked to add the index, i'm a bit curious on how are we going to manage this
- [[Oracle]], [[Oracle Metrics 20231025]]
	- to check the priviledges:
		- `SELECT * FROM DBA_SYS_PRIVS where grantee = 'SVISTA';`
		- `SELECT * FROM DBA_TAB_PRIVS where grantee = 'SVISTA';`
		- `SELECT * FROM DBA_ROLE_PRIVS where grantee = 'SVISTA';`
	- [[Oracle Infra Team]]
	- [[Oracle View Only]]
