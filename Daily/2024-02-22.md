so what's for today?
- manage to finish the grafana issue, damn it takes so long to solve
- discuss the vendor list from the architecture meeting 
- 1:1 with tim
- lead the authentication discussing meeting
- attend the engineering town all
- forgetting about the GCP project migration
well not to bad, but yeah i feel a lot of pain on trying to resolve the grafana issue
i guess tomorrow would be the perfect time to start working on SSO again hopefully tomorrow will be able to get a lot of the things done
