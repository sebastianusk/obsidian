another day another shit, let's goo

- as usual, slack
- then email
  - i think the worst is [[RDS]] Blue green deployment
- fix the [[payfazz-content]]
  - so turns out payfazz content is has it's own server and certificate
  - fixed by add new file to roll update the certificate https://github.com/payfazz/gateway-bare/blob/master/update-content
- handling [[Mandiri VPN]]
  - so i want to refactor the code
  - the question is [[VPC]] Routing
    - so if the default route table already has `0.0.0.0/0` to it, do i need to add route tables on [[Subnet]]?
- ended up solving the [[ArgoCD]] running out of memory
  - this is the PR: https://fazzfinancial.slack.com/archives/C034YUS50F2/p1698126192637099
  - but i think there is an issue with secret manager too
- ok i'll continue with [[PCI-DSS]] Audit, filling out
  - [[Oracle Database]] evidences, on ACS and BO DR
    ```sql
        -- find the list of the users
        select username from dba_users where account_status = 'OPEN';
        -- find the profiles
        select * from dba_profiles where PROFILE='USER_PROFILE';
        alter profile USER_PROFILE limit IDLE_TIME 15;
    ```
- continue on [[OVM]]:

  - i cannot check the issue because of this error:

    ```
