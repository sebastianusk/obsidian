There is a request from the legal team to decentralize the infrastructure. I give them 3 options:
1. fully decentralize, need someone to rebuild the infra from the ground up, probably 4 months for 1 engineer dedicated?
2. playing cat and mouse where just decentralize the findings
3. admit we have a centralized system and will need to make some legal agreements on this. require probably months of making sure we can make agreement will also need approval
