A book by Sonke Ahrens, talks about Zettelkasten (the Germany word for slip-box). A system by Niklas Luhmann. Where he produced a ton of materials, and he claimed that it was because of the slip-box
# The procedure of taking notes
This obsidian is trying to follow the Zettelkasten, so the procedure of zettelkasten in explained in detail in [[PRD0009-My own Zettelkasten]]
# Type of notes
- Fleeing note: where you just immediately note during the day
- Permanent: the zettelkasten itself
- Project: temporary during the project's run
# Link of the Zettelkasten
- Link to overview topics (important) 
- Location on the local slip box
- next & previous note
- note to note the link (important)
# Principles
- Require growth mindset, where Zettelkasten will always try to correct, related to [[DEVO0001-Dev Ops Principles]]
- To take notes, you have to split the task into atoms, you cannot multitask. 
- Try to be an expert, not a planner. A planner will have all the structure but experts see patterns and understand the meaning behind everything
- Open tasks occupy the mind, so taking notes will help [[PRD0004-Power of Collection Habit]]
- On taking notes, try to keep in mind that the final goal is to put them into your slip-box
- Re-reading is useless, try to rephrase the content in your mind in your slip-box, it should be better for you
- Make connections to other notes, it will gradually grow and you'll see the compounding effect later
- Forgetting is a mental barrier to long-term memory. Storage strength is by re-reading and making you remember. But we have to also focus on retrieval strength, and the slip box is a tool to improve retrieval strength
- On writing the slip-box, there are a few limitations that will be there, work on top of that, it's like [[SWE0001-Clean Architecture]]
- New idea is generated after we are familiar with the current idea. sometimes you'll be biased that new idea is good just to found out the idea has been tried before
