Docker is doing weird with its license, basically they don't allow docker desktop usage for enterprise companies. There are several replacement of it:
- podman desktop: daemonless approach
- colima: there is an issue
- orbstack: paid, there is an issue
- rancher desktop: probably the best to emulate what docker desktop do
