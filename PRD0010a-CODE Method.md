# Capture
- The initial step to building the knowledge base
- Can capture story, insight, memory, reflection, and even musings
- We need to avoid Sensitive content, specially formatted, large files, and collaboratively edited
- Keep some questions open for you so you'll be able to keep thinking from time to time and record any essential [[PRD0011-Open Questions Life]]
- Criteria of items that should be captured: inspiring, useful, personal, and surprising
- Can be in the form of multiple tools but I think Google Keep & Todoist are the best
# Organize
- there is a story about Twyla Tharp's box, where she keeps records on her dancing career projects. it gives her the ability to revisit, look back to past victories, and provide security to venture ideas
- There is a cathedral effects, where high ceiling buildings, will make us think abstractly, as low ceiling ones will shape more concrete thinking, so we need to make our second brain give us good environment to think
- [[PRD0010a1-PARA]]
- When organizing the notes, try to find the expected output so you'll think about the finish line when organizing and writing them
- People basically need clear workspace, new things are the one that really matters, you don't have to keep the old notes etc
- Try to move quickly and touch lightly. So don't brute force, try to find the lowest effort to the right direction
