Zeigarnik Effect is a situation where you have tasks that occupy your mind. This will keep you busy trying to remember everything. This is very bad and causes your brain to just keep remembering stuff. The goal is to try to offload these into some set of notes so you can just think of stuffs that's important
In facing task, you have the power to:
- don't do it
- do it
- renegotiate
