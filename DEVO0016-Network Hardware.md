# Switch
used to create VLAN: so it's like virtual local area network
from our switch, we can create VLAN and in VLAN we can configure tagging. if the tagging matches, then it can communicate each other
# Firewall
to inspect it's package sending and it can also check if the traffic is allowed or not. there are two types:
- stateful firewall: 
	- tracks connection, interface, etc
	- e.g. AWS NACL, Fortigate Firewall
- stateless firewall:
	- just check source, destination, & port
	- e.g. security group
