| Innodb_buffer_pool_reads         | The number of logical reads that InnoDB could not satisfy from the buffer pool and had to read directly from disk       |
| Innodb_buffer_pool_pages_data    | The number of pages in the InnoDB buffer pool containing data. The number includes both dirty and clean pages           |
| Innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests | The number of logical read requests                                                                                     |

| Opened_tables                    | The number of tables that have been opened. If Opened _tables is big your table_open _cache value is probably too small |
