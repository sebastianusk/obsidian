I need EMs help to define the authorization grouping. Few points:
- gather any feature request
- let them know they're responsible for their resources
- ask them if the auth group level makes sense

The question that I got from giving a full explanation:
- what about Metabase & tableau? let's list it out first
- what's the position of IT support? for now, probably considered a default engineer
- is this one related to the dashboard? it's up to the dashboard owner
