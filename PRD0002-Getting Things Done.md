It's a book by David Allen, where it's action-based. This is the first time I have learned about productivity and some basic principles that I can use to make sure my mind is clear
# Collect Everything Into Notes
Just collect everything, and use multiple tools to capture everything see [[PRD0006-Tools to collect]]
# Process
Try to decide on where all of the inbox is going, this is the routine that's executed to make sure process the application

# Organize
Reorganize the notes into some of the tools that we're using once we finish processing see [[PRD0008-Tools to Organize]]
# Review
Keeping your system functional, it's included in [[PRD0007-Regular Routine to Process My Thought]]
# Do
then after you have everything in the organizer tools, you have to execute. Asses these things to pick the correct task that you can execute
- context (where are you? Make sure you can do stuff on the correct situation)
- time available
- energy available
- priority
There are models to evaluate the daily work
- Doing predefined work
- Doing work as it shows up
- Defining your work
As for priority, six-level for review it's goal:
- Runway: current action
- 10,000 ft: current project
- 20,000 ft: area of responsibility
- 30,000 ft: One to Two year goals
- 40,000 ft: Three to five year vision
- 50,000+ ft: life
