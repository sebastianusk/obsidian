To write Zettelkasten there are a bit of rules related to code
- [[Index]] is the top of the Zettelkasten
- code, we have:
	- PRD - Productivity
	- SWE - Software engineering
	- DEVO - DevOps & Infrastructure
	- HEAL - Health & Exercise
	- FIN - Financial
- and then followed by the main number
- notes can follow each other, if the notes are following the next, just add a letter, and if followed by another one, just add the number in behind again
