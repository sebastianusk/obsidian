It's a AWS partner that can help us to resell AWS
They can help to:
- manage payment to entities (splitting bills etc)
- giving support to handle AWS issues
- training & workshops related to AWS products
- flex save: they buy saving plans, then give them to us so we can get saving plans on top of ours
- help us monitor our infrastructure costs
